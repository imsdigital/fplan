  1.  General Questions

  1.1.  What are the software requirements for running fplan?

  fplan was developed primarily for use on systems running the UNIX
  Operating System and the X11 Window System (with particular emphasis
  on Linux). If you build from source code on a UNIX system, you will
  need either the XView Toolkit, or the Gnome, Gtk+, Glib libraries. On
  OS/2 and MS-DOS systems, the code can be built with the graphical
  previewer disabled. Once the beta testing phase is complete, OS/2 and
  MS-DOS binaries will be made available.

  2.  Database Problems

  2.1.  Where can I get a free database with coverage outside the USA?

  To my knowledge, there is no reliable source for airport and navaid
  information for regions outside the United States that is in the
  public domain. For now, your only option is to construct a small
  database of your own using information from other sources. See the
  user's guide for information on how to construct your own database
  files.

  At this time, it appears that the only viable long term solution is to
  purchase data from a commercial vendor in ARINC 424-13 format (a
  published standard for the exchange of navigation data) and convert it
  into a format compatible with fplan.  Each end user would have to
  purchase the desired data since the licensing generally prohibits
  further distribution.  In theory, software could be written to do the
  required conversion. However, this is not a simple task since the
  ARINC 424-13 format is quite complex. Send me a note if you are
  interested in this.

  It's worth repeating here that the freely distributable database for
  the USA should not be considered accurate and up to date. The web site
  that distributes the NFDC data clearly states; "FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES
  ONLY -- NOT CERTIFIED FOR NAVIGATION". Users of the freely
  distributable database files are encouraged to validate information
  they use by comparing with reliable sources.

  2.2.  Why isn't airport or navaid XYZ in your stupid database?

  It's possible that you are using the wrong identifier. Don't forget
  that the fplan airport database uses the "K" convention. You've
  probably heard of it if you own a GPS receiver. It's basically a
  mechanism designed to deal with the fact that there are airports and
  navaids out there with the same identifier. For an airport with an
  identifier that is 3 alphabetic characters long, simply prefix it with
  the "K" character. (Do this regardless of whether there is a
  navigational aid with the same identifier or not). If it contains
  numeric characters, or is not exactly 3 characters long, don't prefix
  it with the "K" character. For example, HMT becomes KHMT, L78 remains
  L78, and CL35 remains CL35. Remember that you can use the lookup mode
  to get a summary of information in the database for any given
  identifier (using the -l option).

  The freely database for the USA is available in two flavors. The
  complete version that contains all airports, both public and private
  usage, and a version with only public usage airports (although they
  could still be privately owned). If you downloaded the smaller public
  database, it's possible the airport in question is for private usage
  only.

  2.3.  I get an error message saying fplan can't find the databases?

  Most likely, it's because you installed the database files somewhere
  other than where fplan is looking for them. The default directory
  under UNIX is /usr/share/fplan. If you built fplan from source,
  examine config.h and Makefile to determine the value of the macro
  DEFAULT_COMMON_DBDIR. Compare this with where you installed the
  database files. Also, verify that the database files have read
  permission. Another solution is to set the FPLAN_COMMON_DBDIR
  environment variable to reflect where you actually put the files. The
  best place to do this is in the initialization file for your command
  shell, the ~/.cshrc for C shell users, or the ~/.profile for Bourne
  shell users.
