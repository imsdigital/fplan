<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 About fplan</A></H2>

<P>The fplan application is designed to assist general aviation pilots in
creating flight plans for cross country flights in powered aircraft.
It was developed primarily for use on systems running the UNIX Operating
System and the X11 Window System, with particular emphasis on Linux.</P>

<P>The input to fplan is a planfile that can be created with the user's
favorite plain text editor. A self explanatory language is used to
describe the flight; departure and destination airports, intermediate
waypoints, navigation aids, winds aloft, and fuel consumption rates.
The flight plan produced by fplan includes; wind corrected magnetic
headings, distance, estimated time and fuel consumption for each leg,
latitude and longitude for each checkpoint, and optional VOR fixes.
A graphical preview of the flight is available on systems with X11
Windows and the XView Toolkit.</P>

<P>For convenience, airports or navaids can be referenced by their ICAO
identifier in planfiles.  The information that fplan requires is stored in
database files, indexed by identifier.  For users in the United States,
freely distributable database files are available that were derived from
information from the National Flight Data Center. This data is <EM>not</EM>
certified for navigation, and should be verified before actual use. It
is unfortunate, but there is no known public domain source for similar
information for areas outside the United States. (See the FAQ for more
information).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Change History</A></H2>

<P>The original author of fplan is Steve Tynor. His last public release
was version 1.3, which was posted to volume 30 of the USENET newsgroup,
comp.sources.misc in 1992. The file <CODE>CHANGE.LOG</CODE> contains a detailed
description of the specific changes made to the source code over its
lifetime. The sections below present an overview of the changes I have
made since I took over as the new maintainer.</P>

<H3>Changes from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2</H3>

<P>Release 1.4.2 of fplan contains an implementation of the graphical
previewer based on the Gnome, Gtk+, Glib libraries. It also contains a
number of bug fixes for problems reported by users. This release should
still be considered a <EM>beta release</EM>! All users are encouraged
to upgrade. Highlights of the bug fixes are listed below.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A bug in the decode_common() function was fixed. It
affected all plans containing waypoints with east magnetic variation,
east longitude, or south latitude. The minutes field was not inheriting
the arithmetic sign of the degrees field as the man page states.</LI>
<LI>A bug related to the use of static read buffers was fixed in the
paddb utility. It resulted in the generation of extraneous records
that could potentially confuse the fast binary lookup algorithm
used in fplan.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Changes from 1.4 to 1.4.1</H3>

<P>Release 1.4.1 of fplan contains <EM>many</EM> changes since the last public
release by Steve Tynor (version 1.3). Because of the extensive scope of my
changes, this release should be considered a <EM>beta release</EM>!</P>

<P>There were several basic goals of my changes; review the correctness of
the navigation related algorithms and improve where possible, improve
the documentation and examples, improve the user interface, and improve
the portability of the source code. The order roughly reflects my
assigned priority, from highest to lowest. Highlights of the changes
and new features are listed below.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Updated airport and navaid database files.</LI>
<LI>New implementation of graphical previewer (based on XView Toolkit).</LI>
<LI>New and improved waypoint types;
<UL>
<LI>New Intersection waypoint type (i.e., intersection of VOR radials).</LI>
<LI>New Relative waypoint type (direction and distance from identifier).</LI>
<LI>Lat/Lon waypoints now have a more user friendly input syntax.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Enhanced output format (more precise lat/lon for use with GPS).</LI>
<LI>Enhanced error checking of planfile syntax and semantics.</LI>
<LI>More detailed documentation and examples.</LI>
<LI>Source code is now ANSI C compatible.</LI>
<LI>Many miscellaneous bug fixes.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
