<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Overview of Creating a Flight Plan</A></H2>

<P>Creating a flight plan with fplan involves the following basic steps,
determining the desired flight route(s), creating a planfile that reflects
the desired route(s), and finally feeding the planfile to fplan which then
grinds through all the calculations for computing the true and magnetic
courses, estimated ground speeds, wind corrected headings, and so on.
This section provides a brief overview of the steps required to create
your own flight plans using fplan.</P>

<H3>Determining the Flight Route</H3>

<P>Any pilot who hasn't been living in a cave has very likely seen some of
the commercial flight planning programs currently on the market. Some
provide a GUI interface that allows you to point and click on the desired
flight waypoints from a "sectional quality" chart display. I'd love to
see fplan have this capability, but at this time it is <EM>not</EM> feasible.
Digital charts of adequate quality (complete with victor airways, airspace
boundaries and so forth) are simply not available from NOAA or any other
government source at this time (see 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#future-plans">Future Plans</A> below).</P>

<P>For the purpose of determining the best (and safest) flight route,
your best resource is still a current NOAA Sectional Chart. While this
doesn't rank very high on some people's "Gee Whiz" scale, it provides
complete, accurate, and up to date navigational information which,
<EM>should</EM> be an important consideration when preparing a flight plan.
Just as with the "old fashioned" approach to flight planning, it's a
good idea to mark your flight route(s) on the chart and take it with
you on the flight.</P>

<H3>Creating the planfile</H3>

<P>The next step in the process is to create a planfile that reflects
your chosen flight route. The user's personal and system wide or common
database files allow you to specify a waypoint by its identifier for the
case of an airport or navaid. You can also specify latitude and longitude
for general landmarks, an intersection of radials from navaids or
airports, or a point relative to an identifier (RNAV coordinates). At this
point you may want to browse through some of the example planfiles to get
a better feeling for how waypoints can be specified. The provided examples
also serve as useful templates for creating your own planfiles. You will
need a plain text editor to create the files (such as vi, Xemacs under
Unix systems, or the Notepad application under MS-Windows).</P>

<P>In the case of navaids, you can get the associated
identifier directly from a Sectional Chart. In the case of airports,
you can refer to the "Airport/Facility Directory" published by NOAA, or
similar publications available from commercial sources such as 
<A HREF="http://www.flightguide.com/">Airguide Publications, Inc.</A>
You should also be aware of the airport identifier convention used by
the fplan databases (see 
<A HREF="#identifier-convention">Airport Identifier Convention</A>). To verify that your identifiers are consistent
with those in the provided databases, use fplan's lookup mode to
retrieve the information associated with your identifiers
(see 
<A HREF="#execution-modes">execution modes</A>).</P>

<H3>Further Reading</H3>

<P>At some point in time you should read the following section on the airport
and navaid databases distributed with fplan. Impatient or experienced
computer users can probably treat the section below that describes the
planfile syntax as a reference and examine some of the provided example
planfiles to get started. The fplan output is mostly self explanatory,
but a section is included below that describes the fplan output in more
detail. The fplan manual page provides detailed information on command
line options when running fplan.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Airport and Navaid Databases</A></H2>

<P>The database files distributed with fplan contain a list of airports,
balloonports, gliderports, heliports (in the file <CODE>airports.nav</CODE>),
fixes, intersections, and navaids (in the file <CODE>vors.nav</CODE>).  Two
versions of the database are available; the complete version that contains
<EM>all</EM> airports, both public and private usage, and a version with only
public usage airports (although they could be privately owned).  At this
time the database contains information only for the United States. You
may also wish to construct a personal database that contains entries for
points of interest in your local area (see 
<A HREF="#personal-databases">personal databases</A>). When trying to locate information for a
given identifier, fplan always searches the user's personal databases
<EM>before</EM> searching the system wide, or common databases.</P>

<H3>Origin of the Database Information</H3>

<P>The databases distributed with fplan were created using information from
the (United States) National Flight Data Center. I wrote another software
package to reformat the NFDC data (see 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#avdbtools-software">avdbtools</A> below) for use with fplan. At one time, the National
Flight Data Center distributed the databases on magnetic media only
(no doubt one of the reasons that the old fplan database files were
not updated very frequently). Now you can get the NFDC database files
directly from their world web site at</P>

</P>

<H3><A NAME="identifier-convention"></A> Airport Identifier Convention</H3>

<P>This release of the <CODE>airports.nav</CODE> database uses the "K" convention to
distinguish between airports and navigation aids with the same identifier
(a convention used by many GPS manufacturers). In this convention, all
airport identifiers that are exactly 3 alphabetic characters long are
prefixed by the character, "K", <EM>regardless</EM> of whether there is a
navigational aid with the same identifier or not. Airport identifiers
that are longer than 3 characters or contain numeric characters are
unchanged. For example, HMT becomes KHMT, L78 remains L78, and CL35
remains CL35.</P>

<H3>Magnetic Variation of Airports and Navaids</H3>

<P>The creation of the fplan database files was greatly complicated
by the fact that the navaid files from NFDC no longer had <EM>any</EM>
entry for magnetic variation. To solve this problem, I needed a good
model to calculate the magnetic variation for a given latitude and
longitude referenced to some datum. I concluded that the best solution
was to use one of the geomagnetic field models in common use by the
Geophysics community. The two most commonly encountered models are the
International Geomagnetic Reference Field, 1995 Revision (IGRF-95),
and the United States Department of Defense World Magnetic Model, 1995
Revision (WMM-95). In these models, the geomagnetic field potential
is represented by a summation of spherical harmonics (using associated
Legendre functions). The coefficients are found by fitting the model to
precise measurements of the earth's geomagnetic field. A secular change
model is used to account for the slow drifting of the earth's magnetic
field over time. The models are updated once every five years with the
next model due to come out in the year 2000.</P>

<P>The database files distributed with fplan use the DoD World Magnetic
Model, 1995 Revision (WMM-95) to estimate the magnetic variation of
<EM>all airports and navaids</EM>. I could have used the NFDC database
entries for variation of airports. However a closer examination of some
of the data seemed to suggest that it had not been updated to account
for secular change. (Several spot checks did not agree well with values
taken from a current NOAA Sectional Chart). For consistency, it seemed
best to use the WMM-95 model for both airports and navaids. You can find
a more complete discussion of the model physics, accuracy of the models,
and my numerical implementation of them in the avdbtools user's guide
(see section 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#avdbtools-software">avdbtools</A> below).</P>

<H3><A NAME="datums-and-gps"></A> Accuracy of Database with GPS Receivers</H3>

<P>General aviation pilots have discovered the many advantages offered
by GPS (Global Positioning System) units in a big way. A GPS receiver,
together with a programmable navigation computer running on an embedded
microprocessor, provides unsurpassed accuracy and convenience for as little
as a few hundred dollars. The accuracy of civilian units that use only
the C/A code on frequency L1 are such that the computed position is within
100 meters of the actual position about 95% of the time. However,
don't be seduced by the accuracy of the system hardware itself. You probably
won't do anywhere near that good using coordinates from this database.</P>

<P>An issue you need to consider is consistency of datums.  A datum is
a set of parameters that define a mathematical ellipsoid designed to
approximate the earth's actual surface or geoid (the equatorial radius
of the earth is about 21 nautical miles larger than the polar radius).
You must specify the latitude, longitude, <EM>and the associated datum</EM>
to uniquely describe a given point on the earth's surface. Most GPS
receivers are configured by default to use the World Geodetic System of
1984, or WGS-84 datum, which is also the datum used on NOAA Sectional
Charts. Some datums are designed to be a reasonably good fit over most of
the earth's surface (like WGS-84), while others are carefully designed to
provide the absolute best possible accuracy in a <EM>very small area</EM>
(such as the one that was developed for the construction of the tunnel
under the English Channel). Most GPS receivers can be configured to use
any one of a wide variety of published datums (my trusty Garmin 89 has
104 choices).</P>

<P>The error associated with inconsistent datums can be <EM>almost a
mile</EM> in some cases, and is greater than 100 meters to be sure! The bad
news is that I have <EM>not</EM> been able to determine the datum associated
with the latitude, longitudes values given in the NFDC databases. It's
possible that no uniform datum was used (another possible reason why
the NFDC does not represent the database as an official product). Of
course you can always validate a latitude, longitude value from the
database or a latitude, longitude value calculated by fplan by just
taking the few minutes it takes to plot it on a current NOAA Sectional
or VFR Terminal Area Chart. This also shows you exactly where a GPS unit
(configured for the WGS-84 datum), would take you.</P>

<P>Don't feel bad if this is all news to you. It seems that even the US
military is still educating itself on this issue. During the Gulf War,
many of the errors in high altitude B-52 bombing runs over Iraq were
traced to inconsistent datums. You can find an interesting discussion
of this and datums in general at

</P>

<H3>Other Database Quality Issues</H3>

<P>You should be aware of the fact that the database files from the National
Flight Data Center (used to construct the ones distributed with fplan)
are not official products approved for navigation. To be more specific,
the NFDC world wide web site clearly states, <CODE>"FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES
ONLY -- NOT CERTIFIED FOR NAVIGATION"</CODE>.</P>

<P>I don't know all the reasons why NFDC makes this disclaimer, they are
listed in the "Airport/Facility Guide" as the main point of contact
for reporting errors in that information. Funding is no doubt one
issue. The issues related to the magnetic variation values discussed
above are another obvious reason, but there could easily be many other
issues as well. <EM>It would be prudent to heed this clear warning and
validate information used from the database files with other available
sources</EM>. For example, if you question the validity of a latitude and
longitude value you can simply plot the point on a Sectional Chart. It's
only common sense that any database of this size <EM>will</EM> have errors
in it so exercise appropriate care.</P>

<H3><A NAME="personal-databases"></A> Creating your own Personal Database</H3>

<P>For your convenience, fplan allows users to have personal databases of
their own. They are always searched <EM>before</EM> the system wide or common
database of the same type (airport or VOR). The common database files
distributed with fplan only provide coverage for the United States.
Users that live outside the United States will want to construct a
personal database for their local area. No matter where you live,
personal databases are useful for defining things like boundaries
of controlled airspace, mountain passes or other geographical points
of interest, emergency landing sites, and so on. It may be wise to
choose personal identifiers that begin with an underscore (the "_"
character) to distinguish them from identifiers in the common database.
This is not a requirement, but it's a useful mechanism for eliminating
any possible confusion.</P>

<P>The format of both the common and personal database files are described
in the fplan entry in section 5 of the man pages (users of non-Unix
systems can refer to the formatted version of this document in the
file <CODE>fplan_5.ps</CODE> or <CODE>fplan_5.txt</CODE>). Note that the text versions of
your personal database files must be processed by the paddb application
before they can be read by fplan. You can install your personal database
files anywhere you like. Simply set the <CODE>FPLAN_USER_DBDIR</CODE> environment
variable to the directory where it can be found. (The best place
to do this is in the initialization file for your command shell, the
<CODE>~/.cshrc</CODE> or <CODE>~/.profile</CODE> files for Unix shell
users, the <CODE>CONFIG.SYS</CODE> file for OS/2 users, or the <CODE>AUTOEXEC.BAT</CODE>
file for MS-DOS users).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Description of planfile Syntax</A></H2>

<P>fplan reads a free format input language to specify the departure and
destination airports, intermediate waypoints, fuel on board, fuel burn
rates, winds aloft, etc. This section presents a detailed reference
for the syntax of the planfile and planfile statements. However, you
will likely find the syntax of the fplan language to be largely self
explanatory. Impatient or experienced computer users may want to skip this
section and examine some of the provided example planfiles instead. In
any case, the provided examples serve as useful templates for creating
your own planfiles. Here is an overview of the syntax of the planfile;</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The planfile consists of any number of statements, each
terminated by a semicolon ";" character.
</LI>
<LI> All reserved words of the language and user input tokens must be
separated by white spaces (either a blank, comma, tab or newline character).
</LI>
<LI> When fplan encounters a "#" comment character while reading a
planfile, all the characters that follow it on that line are silently
discarded. Comments can legally appear anywhere in the planfile where
a white space is legal. This means it is possible to break a statement
up into multiple lines with comments on each line. This often greatly
enhances the readability of the planfile.
</LI>
<LI> Reserved words that are part of the language are case sensitive,
they <EM>must</EM> be lowercase. However, identifiers are not case sensitive
and may be written in either upper or lower case.
</LI>
<LI> In the case of a conflict between an identifier and an fplan
reserved word (for example an airport named VIA), use upper case to
prevent fplan from interpreting the identifier as a reserved word
of the language.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Specifying Units</H3>

<P>In the planfile, the default unit for distance (except for altitudes)
is nautical miles and the default unit for speed (such as true airspeed
of the aircraft and wind speeds) is knots (nautical miles per hour). You
can specify different units by using appropriate keywords <EM>after</EM>
any numeric value. The keywords are</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>mi</B>, <B>smi</B> - statue miles</LI>
<LI><B>nm</B>, <B>nmi</B> - nautical miles</LI>
<LI><B>mph</B> - statue miles per hour</LI>
<LI><B>knots</B>, <B>kts</B> - nautical miles per hour</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In the output flight plan the default unit for distance is nautical
miles and the default unit for speed (such as true airspeed of the
aircraft and wind speed) is knots (nautical miles per hour). You can
change this to statue miles and statue miles per hour by including the
<CODE>-s</CODE> flag on the command line.</P>

<H3>Waypoint Statements</H3>

<P>The planned flight route is specified by of a sequence of waypoint
statements which begin with either the <B>from</B>, <B>via</B>, or <B>to</B>
reserved words, corresponding to the departure waypoint, enroute waypoints,
and destination waypoint, respectively. The planfile can contain more than
one route. This is useful for computing several routes ahead of time and
selecting the best one on the day of the flight.</P>

<P>The order in which the databases are searched is different for terminal
and enroute waypoints. For the case of a departure or destination
waypoint (the <B>from</B> or <B>to</B> keywords), the <CODE>airports.nav</CODE>
databases are searched first, then the <CODE>vors.nav</CODE> databases are
searched for the given identifier. For the case of an enroute waypoint
(the <B>via</B> keyword), the <CODE>vors.nav</CODE> databases are searched
first, then the <CODE>airports.nav</CODE> databases. In each of these cases,
when the <CODE>airports.nav</CODE> databases are searched, the user's personal
<CODE>airports.nav</CODE> database is searched <EM>before</EM> the system wide,
or common <CODE>airports.nav</CODE> database. Similarly, when the <CODE>vors.nav</CODE>
databases are searched, the user's personal <CODE>vors.nav</CODE> database is
searched <EM>before</EM> the system wide, or common <CODE>vors.nav</CODE> database.
The syntax of the waypoint statements are now described.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>(from|via|to) identifier;</B><DD><P>Specifies a waypoint by its identifier. It is an error if
<B>identifier</B> cannot be found in any of the databases.</P>

<DT><B>(from|via|to) identifier_1 radial_1 identifier_2 radial_2 { name { city { comment } } };</B><DD><P>Specifies an intersection waypoint. Both <B>radial_1</B> and
<B>radial_2</B> represent the <EM>magnetic</EM> direction from the
reference points corresponding to the respective identifiers to the
desired waypoint. The convention of magnetic direction is a natural
choice since VOR radials are magnetic, rather than true. An error is
issued if no intersection exists or the intersection is poorly conditioned
(when the defining directions are almost parallel to each other). Up to
three optional quoted strings corresponding to the <B>name</B>, <B>city</B>,
and <B>comment</B> fields in the output form may be specified.  It is an
error if <B>identifier_1</B> or <B>identifier_2</B> cannot be
found in any of the databases.</P>

<DT><B>(from|via|to) identifier direction / distance { name { city { comment } } };</B><DD><P>Specifies a relative waypoint (like an entry to an RNAV computer).
The specified <B>direction</B> of the waypoint relative to <B>identifier</B>
is assumed to be in degrees <EM>magnetic</EM>, rather than true. As always,
the specified <B>distance</B> is in nautical miles, unless an appropriate
distance qualifier keyword is present that specifies otherwise.
One should avoid using a <B>distance</B> that is excessively large because
the magnetic variation used for the waypoint is the same value as for
<B>identifier</B> (a few tens of nautical miles is not a problem). Up to
three optional quoted strings corresponding to the <B>name</B>, <B>city</B>,
and <B>comment</B> fields in the output form may be specified. It is an
error if <B>identifier</B> cannot be found in any of the databases.</P>

<DT><B>(from|via|to) latitude longitude variation { name { city { comment } } };</B><DD><P>Specifies a waypoint by its latitude and longitude. The format for
<B>latitude</B> and <B>longitude</B> entries are; integer valued degrees,
the ":" character, integer valued arc minutes, the ":" character,
decimal arc seconds, a white space, and the <B>north</B> or <B>south</B>
keyword for <B>latitude</B>, or the <B>east</B> or <B>west</B> keyword for
<B>longitude</B>. The magnetic <B>variation</B> must be specified because
it is required to convert a true course to a magnetic one. The format
for the magnetic <B>variation</B> entry is; decimal degrees followed by
a white space and either the <B>east</B> or <B>west</B> keyword. Up to
three optional quoted strings corresponding to the <B>name</B>,
<B>city</B>, and <B>comment</B> fields in the output form may be
specified.</P>

<DT><B>via distance { name { city { comment } } };</B><DD><P>Specifies an incremental waypoint. Note that the incremental waypoint
can be used only in an enroute context. If <B>distance</B> is positive, it
specifies the distance from or after the last non-incremental waypoint. If
negative, the absolute value of <B>distance</B> specifies the distance
to or before the next non-incremental waypoint. Incremental waypoints
are useful for dead reckoning flight where it is desirable to have
checkpoints every so often. They are also a very useful for specifying
the end of climb to cruise, or for specifying the beginning of descent
(this admits more precise specification of fuel rates, and estimates of
fuel consumption). Up to three optional quoted strings corresponding
to the <B>name</B>, <B>city</B>, and <B>comment</B> fields in the output
form may be specified. Note that successive incremental waypoints still
refer to the <EM>same</EM> previous non-incremental waypoint and <EM>not</EM>
to the last incremental waypoint as one might think. Thus the following
two successive waypoint statements refer to <EM>exactly the same point</EM>
<UL>
<LI><B>via 10 'point 1';</B></LI>
<LI><B>via 10 'point 2';</B></LI>
</UL>
</P>

</DL>
</P>

<H3>Fuel Management Statements</H3>

<P>The following statements are used to specify the initial amount of usable
fuel on board, the fuel burn rate(s), and any additional fuel used.
In order for fuel consumption computations to be made, the initial amount
of usable fuel on board and the fuel burn rate <EM>must</EM> be specified.</P>

<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>fuel_amount quantity;</B><DD><P>Specifies the initial amount of usable fuel on board. The value given
for the numeric argument <B>quantity</B> must be a positive number. The
units used for <B>quantity</B> are arbitrary; pounds, gallons, imperial
gallons, quarts, liters or whatever units happen to be convenient. Note
that <B>quantity</B> should <EM>not</EM> include any unusable fuel on board.
This statement applies to the waypoint at the start of the current leg.
It is an error for this statement to be applied to a waypoint that is
not a departure waypoint (specified by the <B>from</B> keyword).</P>

<DT><B>fuel_rate rate;</B><DD><P>Specifies the fuel consumption rate. The value given for the numeric
argument <B>rate</B> must be a positive number, and in units per hour,
where the units used agree with those used in the <B>fuel_amount</B>
directive above. This statement applies to the current and all successive
legs until another <B>fuel_rate</B> statement is encountered. You may
want to include a waypoint for the end of the climb to cruise, and at the
start of the descent for landing, so that the fuel rates can be updated
for the power settings used (incremental waypoints are a good choice).</P>

<DT><B>fuel_used quantity;</B><DD><P>Specifies any additional fuel used that is not accounted for by the
enroute flight time and fuel burn rate (such as extra amounts used for
taxi, run up, traffic related delays and so on).  The units used for
the numeric argument <B>quantity</B> must agree with the units used in
the <B>fuel_amount</B> directive to remain consistent. This
statement applies to the waypoint at the start of the current leg.</P>

</DL>
</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous Statements</H3>

<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>alt feet;</B><DD><P>Specifies the flight altitude in feet above mean sea level. In the
current version of fplan, the value is simply copied to the output form,
but future versions may use it for density altitude or similar performance
related computations.</P>

<DT><B>comment string;</B><DD><P>The given <B>string</B> replaces the comment field of the previous waypoint
in the route. If this statement appears before the first waypoint statement
in the planfile, it has no effect.</P>

<DT><B>nav number identifier;</B><DD><P>Specifies that the VOR receiver given by <B>number</B> will be tuned to the
station given by <B>identifier</B>. The binary distribution is configured
to accept up to 6 navigation receivers. VOR fixes are computed for each
receiver and waypoint in the route(s). It is an error if <B>identifier</B>
cannot be found in any of the databases.</P>
<P>Note that when auto track is enabled (default is disabled), receiver
1 is automatically tuned to the next waypoint (if it is a navigation
aid), or to the previous waypoint (if it is a navigation aid) and user
specified values for <B>nav 1</B> are silently ignored. Auto track can
be enabled with the <CODE>-t</CODE> command line switch.</P>

<DT><B>tas speed;</B><DD><P>Specifies the true airspeed of the aircraft. This statement applies to
the current and all successive legs until another <B>tas</B> statement
is encountered. If no <B>tas</B> statement is included in the planfile,
enroute time and fuel consumption estimates can not be made.</P>

<DT><B>wind direction @ speed;</B><DD><P>Specifies the direction and speed of winds aloft. The <B>direction</B>
argument must be in units of degrees relative to true north. This is the
convention used in the winds aloft forecast from Flight Service. (Recall
that winds are always reported in degrees with respect to true north,
except when reported by the control tower or in (automated) airport
surface observations, in which case they are relative to magnetic north,
as runways are). This statement applies to the current and all successive
legs until another <B>wind</B> statement is encountered. If no <B>wind</B>
statement is included in the planfile, the winds aloft are assumed to
be calm.</P>

<H2><A NAME="execution-modes"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Execution of fplan </A></H2>

<P>In this section, we provide a brief overview of running fplan. For a
complete reference on command line syntax and options, see the provided
man page. fplan can be run in one of four different major <EM>modes</EM> which
are described below. The different modes are selected by using the
appropriate flag as the <EM>first</EM> command line option.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>Normal Mode</B><DD><P>In normal or default mode, the given planfile is parsed, the flight
route(s) are computed, and a flight plan including wind corrected
headings, distance, estimated time, and fuel consumption for each leg,
VOR fixes for each checkpoint, and so on, are written to the standard
output. Normal mode is the <EM>default</EM> mode of operation and does
not require any special flag as the first command line option.</P>

<DT><B>Graphics Mode</B><DD><P>In graphics mode, the specified planfile is parsed, the flight route(s)
are computed, and the results are displayed in an XView window. (For
Unix/X11 systems with the XView Toolkit only, also installation
dependent). The window includes buttons for scrolling the chart to the
first and last waypoints, as well as for setting the magnification
scale factor of the chart. Graphics mode is selected by using <CODE>-g</CODE>
as the first command line option.</P>

<DT><B>Lookup Mode</B><DD><P>In the lookup mode of operation, all remaining command line arguments
are assumed to be airport or navaid identifiers. fplan will search the
user's personal and system wide databases and will print information for
each match to the standard output. If any identifier was found in both
the airports and navaid databases, then both entries are printed. Lookup
mode is selected by using <CODE>-l</CODE> as the first command line option.</P>

<DT><B>Reverse Mode</B><DD><P>In reverse mode, the given planfile is parsed, the flight route(s)
are computed, and a planfile for the <EM>return</EM> trip is written to the
standard output. All waypoints are reversed and incremental waypoints are
recomputed. Correct directives are included so that each waypoint uses
the same VORs as in the input planfile. Fuel, altitude, airspeed and wind
statements are <EM>not</EM> included in the reversed planfile. They may be
included in a future release. Reverse mode is selected by using <CODE>-r</CODE>
as the first command line option.</P>

</DL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Computed Courses and Headings</A></H2>

<P>Although there are an infinite number of courses that connect two given
points on the earth's surface, there are only two meaningful ones,
the great circle and rhumb line courses. By definition, the great
circle course minimizes the distance traveled. It can be visualized as
the intersection of the earth's surface with the unique plane defined
by the center of the earth and the two given points. A great circle
course appears as a straight line on a chart that uses the Gnomonic
projection system. The disadvantage of the great circle course is that
the (calm wind) heading with respect to true north is <EM>not</EM> constant,
except for the special case where the two given points are on the same
meridian (i.e., have identical longitude). Great circle courses and
close approximations to them are routinely used on long distance
transcontinental flights.</P>

<P>This release of fplan computes a rhumb line course. By definition,
it is the constant (calm wind) heading course that connects the two
given points. A rhumb line course appears as a straight line on a chart
that uses the Mercator projection system. At mid latitudes, the extra
distance traveled for the rhumb line course is small when the points are
a few tens or hundreds of nautical miles apart. The rhumb line course
is probably a better choice than the great circle course for general
aviation use. The only corrections to the estimated headings for each
leg that the pilot needs to be concerned about, are those corrections
associated with changing winds aloft.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Description of fplan Output</A></H2>

<P>The fplan output consists of three distinct groups of columns; the waypoint
information columns, the flight leg columns, and the optional VOR fix
columns (disabled by default, and enabled with the <CODE>-w</CODE> command line
option). In the fplan output, each route begins with a group of header
lines. They contain symbolic entries that describe the numeric entry at
that position in the data that follows. Most of them are self explanatory,
but because of space limitations, some of them are not obvious.
They are documented here for completeness.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Hints for Printing fplan Output</A></H2>

<P>Note that fplan sends all of its output to the standard output, which in
most environments is the terminal screen. If you want to capture the
output to a file or print it, you will need to redirect the standard
output. On most systems you can redirect the standard output to a file
by appending <CODE>"&gt; filename"</CODE> to the end of the fplan command line
(without the quotes).</P>

<P>To be useful in practice, we want a hardcopy of the flight plan that is as
legible as possible. In the cockpit, it is desirable to quickly extract
needed information, so we don't get too distracted from other tasks that
are placing demands on our attention. Since the output from fplan is
typically wider than the standard 80 columns supported by the default
portrait mode of most printers, we will need some type of print utility
software (that supports landscape mode and maybe selectable fonts) to get
the best possible results. Note that you must print fplan output using
fixed width fonts. If you print fplan output using fonts with proportional
spacing (like most fonts used in word processors), the columns will no
longer be aligned properly, rendering the output unreadable.</P>

<H3>Printing on Unix Systems</H3>

<P>On Unix systems, the print utilities
<A HREF="http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/">a2ps</A>
and nenscript are both good choices for pretty printing fplan output.
Both support landscape orientation and selectable fonts, and both
generate postscript output. If you are like me and don't have a printer
with hardware support for postscript, don't worry. Just get the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">ghostscript</A> package
and follow the instructions for installing it as a printer filter. (Note
that you don't <EM>have to</EM> install it as a filter, but it most definitely
provides maximum ease of use).</P>

<P>For the a2ps utility, you will likely want to include the following
options; <CODE>-1</CODE> to select one virtual page per physical page for
maximum readability, <CODE>--landscape</CODE> to enable landscape orientation,
<CODE>--columns-per-page=98</CODE> to specify the width of the output (the
value given works for fplan wide format output with two VOR fixes),
and possibly <CODE>--encoding=PCG</CODE> to enable support for IBM PC Graphics
characters (they are present when fplan is run with the <CODE>-e</CODE> flag).</P>

<P>For the nenscript utility, you will likely want to include the following
options; <CODE>-1</CODE> to select single column output for maximum readability,
<CODE>-r</CODE> to enable landscape orientation, <CODE>-f font</CODE> to specify the font
(for fplan wide format output with two VOR fixes, <CODE>Courier12</CODE> works
very well).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Inherent Limitations of fplan</A></H2>

<H3>Spherical Trigonometry</H3>

<P>The algorithms used by fplan for computing the course and distance
between two waypoints, as well as the algorithms used to compute the
location of intersection and relative waypoints have some practical
limitations. Columbus was right, the earth is not flat, but it's not
a perfect sphere either. The earth's shape is best described as an
ellipsoid with the equatorial radius about 21 nautical miles larger than
the polar radius. fplan uses algorithms based on spherical trigonometry
which don't exactly account for the ellipsoidal shape of the earth's
surface.  The approximation used is quite reasonable <EM>provided</EM>
that the distance between waypoints, or the distance from the defining
identifier(s) and intersection or relative waypoints is not too large
(a few tens of nautical miles is not a problem).</P>
