OVERVIEW
========

The fplan application is designed to assist general aviation pilots in
creating flight plans for cross country flights in powered aircraft.
It was developed primarily for use on systems running the UNIX Operating
System and the X11 Window System, with particular emphasis on Linux.

The input to fplan is a planfile that can be created with the user's
favorite plain text editor. A self explanatory language is used to
describe the flight; departure and destination airports, intermediate
waypoints, navigation aids, winds aloft, and fuel consumption rates.
The flight plan produced by fplan includes; wind corrected magnetic
headings, distance, estimated time and fuel consumption for each leg,
latitude and longitude for each checkpoint, and optional VOR fixes.
A graphical preview of the flight is available on systems with X11
Windows and the XView Toolkit.

For convenience, airports or navaids can be referenced by their ICAO
identifier in planfiles.  The information that fplan requires is stored in
database files, indexed by identifier.  For users in the United States,
freely distributable database files are available that were derived
from information from the National Flight Data Center.  This data is not
certified for navigation, and should be verified before actual use. It
is unfortunate, but there is no known public domain source for similar
information for areas outside the United States. (See the FAQ for more
information).
